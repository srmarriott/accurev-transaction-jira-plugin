AccuRev Transaction JIRA Plugin

Originally based on jira-subversion-plugin from Atlassian at
https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jira-subversion-plugin/src   (see LICENSE)

1. Intro

Display AccuRev transactions inside JIRA issues.
 - Transactions linked to a JIRA can be viewed from the "AccuRev Transactions" tab when inside a JIRA issue.
 - The link is made by mentioning JIRA issue(s) in the promote comment e.g. "TEST-123: Fixing some bugs"
 - You can click on the links inside the AccuRev Transactions" tab which will take you to the AccuRev WEB GUI to view diffs and promote information, if the AccuRev WEB GUI has been setup inside the depot configuration.
 - The plugin scans per depot. Depots can be added, removed and modified through the Administration inside JIRA.

2. Setup

Install accurev-transaction-jira-plugin-${VERSION}-SNAPSHOT.jar via Manage Add-Ons, or manually by copying onto file system using Plugins2 method.

Ensure the correct "ACCUREV_HOME" is passed into the JIRA instance at start-up. ACCUREV_HOME is where the accurec login credentials are stored.

Once the plugin is installed, navigate to the "AccuRev Depots" tab which should be alongside the other SCM setup tabs inside JIRA Administration.
JIRA web->Administration->Add-ons->(SOURCE CONTROL) AccuRev Depots. From here you can add or remove depots.

3. Limitations

Have not tested using multiple accurev servers for the depot configuration.

4. Reseting the plugin cache

The plugin uses a cache to store transaction information. The cache is located under $JIRA_HOME/caches/indexes/plugins/accurev-transactions .
To repopulate the cache from scratch simply delete the accurev-transactions directory.
